{Jan 2013 - Dec 2016} % Date(s)
{ % Description(s) bullet points
\begin{cvitems}
\item[]{\textbf{Thesis: Modelling and characterisation of compliant and hydrated materials. Supervised by Prof. Brian Derby}}
% data science 
\item{ Developed algorithms and data analysis pipelines to model the behaviour of biological tissues in Python and R. Such algorithms reduced  the computational time by 70\% as well as the associated errors by 30\% compared to state of the art.}
\item{Developed a sophisticated data acquisition and preservation strategy for real-life data sets between 2 and 25GB size. These were posteriorly analysed using complex data analysis pipelines and classification algorithms in Python and R (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, tidyverse).}
\item{Interpreted complex simulation data using statistical methods implemented in R.}
\item{ Worked in a cross-disciplinary team to develop a unique multi-scale simulation technique and implemented the methodology to explain complex biological phenomena using own generated computational scripts and packages written in Python, FORTRAN, MATLAB and C++.}
%materials 
%\item{Demonstrated an outstanding capacity to work as part of a multidisciplinary team involving staff from the school of materials science, regenerative medicine, and ophthalmology.}
%\item{Incorporated complex materials laws such as non-linear models, poroelasticity, and viscoelasticity.}
%\item{Devised a protocol to assess the mechanical properties of compliant and hydrated materials as well as biological tissues via instrumented Nanoindentation, atomic force microscopy, and dynamic mechanical testing while eliminating common experimental and analytical errors.}
%\item{Evaluated the mechanical properties of a wide range of soft and hydrated samples implementing optimisation protocols and Finite element analysis while formulating novel material models.}
%\item{Mastered and adapted advanced technologies for the synthesis of polymers and hydrogels .}
%\item{Mastered fabrication techniques such as soft lithography and 3D printing for stretchable materials and biocompatible solutions.}
